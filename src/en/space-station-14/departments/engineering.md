# Engineering
The powerhouse of the ~~cell~~ station

## Concept
Engineering is responsible for building, running, maintaining, and repairing life-critical station hardware. No matter what the situation is, engineering keeps the power on and the atmosphere breathable. Engineers are the mechanical problem solvers of the station, and when something breaks, catches fire, and/or explodes, chances are an engineer is already sprinting down the halls to 
- **Primary Goal**: Keep the station habitable and respond to life-support emergencies
- **Secondary Goal**: *Perform* upgrades[1] the station and process raw resources into usable items/equipment.

[1] The difference between engineering and science when it comes to upgrades is that Engineering focuses on the implementation/installation while Science researches/creates the upgrades or their components.
### Design Pillars
#### Problem Solving Not Checklists:
- Engineering gameplay should emphasize creative problem solving, rather than solutions having a list of steps that simply need to be followed to solve the problem. Try to balance solutions with situational benefits/downsides to create ambiguity around what the best solution in the moment might be.
#### An Engineer Never Sleeps:
- Engineers should have a wide variety of things they could potentially be doing at any given moment. Things like regular maintenance of machinery and structures should be fully present such that engineers regularly have things to do if they're otherwise idle. But to avoid conuntering the above pillar, "busywork" should offer multiple options to allow for a creative player to do things efficiently if they put the effort in.
#### Death By A Thousand Cuts:
- When a system fails is shouldn't immediately turn into a catastrophic failure but rather start a chain of events that *can* escalate to a drastic situation. This gives chances for players to attempt to stop the escalation of failure and creates tense/chaotic situations from the escalating tension. You want to create a [Swiss Cheese Effect of Escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model), where there are chances for players to stop the escalation.
#### Strength in Numbers:
- Tasks for engineers should be something that benefits greatly from having the engineering department work as a team, but shouldn't be strictly required. Engineers should benefit heavily from having individuals dedicated to specific subroles like disaster response, as well as allowing the rest of the crew to assist them, but this shouldn't be outright required for the engineering team to maintain the station
### Specific Objectives
- Maintain breathable atmosphere on the station. Both by fixing hull breaches, and managing the gas distribution system.
- Ensure that the station has adequete power, primarily for live support but also for department progression.
- Maintain/Upgrade/Manage the station's power distribution infrastructure, making sure that power gets to where it is needed.
- Construct/Maintain/Manage the power generator(s) (Engine) of the station and keep it functioning safely and efficently.
- Support other departments in construction/maintaince efforts.
- Manufacture heavy components or machinery for use by other departments.
- Maintain/Upgrade the common crafting area so that other departments can use it.

## Player Story
> A short (1-2 paragraph) story from the perspective of someone playing a role in this department. This is effectively a story of the ideal experience of a player interacting with these mechanics/systems. 


## Progression
> How does the *gameplay* of this department change over the course of a round? Are there unlocks? Are players collecting/spending resources? Is this progression tied/related to other departments? If so how?

## Flow
> How does the *experience* of the player change over the course of a round? Are players constantly running around putting out fires or are there breaks in the action? Do players need to wait on other departments as pre-requisites for their own gameplay, or is this department fairly self-sufficent?

## Mechanics
> What major mechanics does this department use and how are they connected to this department.

### Mechanic_Placeholder1
> Each mechanic should have its own subheading and should contain a *short high-level* overview of the mechanic and how it is used by this department. Each mechanic should also link their associated design document as the subheading.

### Mechanic_Placeholder2 (Not Implemented Yet)
> Mechanics that are unimplemented should be marked with (Not Implmented Yet) and should link the associated design proposal if it exists.
